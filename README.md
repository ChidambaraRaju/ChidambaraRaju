# 👋 Hi, I'm Raju (Juu)

🚀 **Aspiring Agentic AI Developer | Gen AI Enthusiast**

I’m passionate about building **Agentic AI systems** and **Generative AI applications** that solve real-world problems. My focus is on exploring **LangGraph, LangChain, and RAG architectures** to design autonomous, intelligent agents.

---

## 🔬 Focus Areas
- **Agentic AI** → Multi-agent systems, autonomy, reasoning with LangGraph  
- **Generative AI** → RAG pipelines, document assistants, and AI-driven recommendations  
- **LLM Applications** → End-to-end apps with Streamlit, LangChain, and vector databases  

---

## 💡 Featured Projects

### 📰 [LangGraph News Agent](https://github.com/yourusername/langgraph-news-agent)
A multi-agent newspaper generator built with **LangGraph**.  
This AI agent understands natural language requests to autonomously research topics, perform self-correcting searches, and compose a polished daily newspaper in a **Streamlit UI**.  
✅ A complete portfolio project.

---

### 🎌 [Anime RAG Recommender](https://github.com/yourusername/anime-rag-recommender)
A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based **Anime Recommendation System**.

---

### 📑 [PDF Pal – RAG Document Assistant](https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-pal-rag-document-assistant)
An AI-powered app for querying and summarizing documents.  
Uses **LangChain, FAISS, and LLMs** to provide a simple yet powerful **Streamlit interface** for interacting with your documents.  

---

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Advanced **multi-agent coordination** with LangGraph  
- Optimizing **RAG pipelines** for speed & accuracy  
- Building portfolio-ready **AI assistants**  

---

## 📌 Beyond AI
- 💼 Exposure to **Appian** (Low-code automation)  
- ♟️ Hobby: **Following chess**
