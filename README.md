# 👋 Hi, I'm Raju (Juu)

🚀 **Aspiring Agentic AI Developer | Gen AI Enthusiast**

I’m passionate about building **Agentic AI systems** and **Generative AI applications** that solve real-world problems. My focus is on exploring **LangGraph, LangChain, and RAG architectures** to design autonomous, intelligent agents.

---

## 🔬 Focus Areas
- **Agentic AI** → Multi-agent systems, autonomy, reasoning with LangGraph  
- **Generative AI** → RAG pipelines, document assistants, and AI-driven recommendations  
- **LLM Applications** → End-to-end apps with Streamlit, LangChain, and vector databases
